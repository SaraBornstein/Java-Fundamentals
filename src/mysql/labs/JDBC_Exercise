JDBC Lab:
Create a new MySQL database on your local machine (using MySQL Workbench)
Create a single table within that database with at least 3 or 4 fields (workbench)
Create a brand new Java application, from scratch (not in the labs project)
Within the new project, create a small application with CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality against the new DB
Your code will need to be able to insert a new record, query that record, update that record, and delete that record
Next insert several rows into the DB and demonstrate how to iterate over a ResultSet and “map” the DB results to an ArrayList of Java objects (the object will be a POJO with the same fields as the DB)

We want this application to be nicely organized and well structured.

For instance, don’t do everything in one method. Break it up into a number of methods each with unique responsibilities -
for instance, insertRecord()  and queryRecords()
