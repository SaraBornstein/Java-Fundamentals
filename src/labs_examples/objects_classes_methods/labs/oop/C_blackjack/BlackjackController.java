BlackjackController.java (this will contain the main())
1) In the BlackJackController, create a method named playBlackJack(). This method will interact with the user by printing
out questions and using a Scanner to get answers. First, create two Player objects. One should have the name of the user
(that they enter through the console) and the other will be the computer player.
2) After you have created both players, deal them each two cards from the deck. These cards should be added to the
players "hand" objects. Print the two cards the user received and their current hand value to the console and ask them
if they want another card. If they say "yes" to another card, deal them another card and print out all their cards and
their hand value again. Then call the computerAi method to determine whether or not the computer wants another card.
Print out whether the computer took another card or not. Repeat this process (asking for another card and dealing doing
this until both the user and the computer say "no" to another card, or until both players hand value is over 21.

3) When both players say "no" to another card (or when both players have "busted" (gone over 21)) print out both the users
hand and hand value as well as the computers hand and hand value and indicate who won, or whether you both lost.

B_polymorphism Exercise_04:
Add a way for the user and the computer to bet. Give the user and computer
both an initial sum of "money" and let them play with it. Take actual bets.
The player should be allowed to bet after they get dealt the first two cards, then again after getting dealt each subsequent card
-if they win, double their bet value and add it to their pot
-if they lose, deduct that amount from their pot
-make sure they donâ€™t bet more than they have. If either user runs out of money, stop the game.
Consistently print out the current amount of money both the user and computer have after each game.

static_nonstatic Exercise_02:
Create a system that will track the total number of BlackJack games that have been played. As well as a
system to track how many games have been won by the computer, and how many have been won by the player.
